I'm sure many people have been recommending NPR's 
[Snap Judgement](http://snapjudgment.org) to me but I just haven't been listening. I finally listened to all my podcasts so I thought I'd give it a go. It's definitely a keeper and there are over 600 past episodes to explore. 
It could be characterized as yet another story telling podcast but it's so well done and not in a pretentious 
[This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org) kinda way ;)
