It's posts like Scott Hanselman's [On the importance of OpenSearch](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/OnTheImportanceOfOpenSearch.aspx) that make me feel the limitations of Safari and Squarespace, you can get an 
[extension](http://www.opensearchforsafari.com) but I can't do the server side part right now. I haven't had time to look into the developer side of squarespace, it probably wouldn't be that hard but I'm enjoying not having to do any development on my own site.
