As I mentioned in [my last post on the subject](http://mttmccb.net/blog/2013/an-app-a-post) I've had no iPhone for about 6 weeks. I still haven't sold my 4S, which is a little disappointing, but that will be subject of another post.

Just to recap, I'm going to write a 500 word review of every app I install and I won't install a new one until I write a review. I'm going to try and make the order deliberate.

It's going to be difficult to stop myself installing apps on a whim.
