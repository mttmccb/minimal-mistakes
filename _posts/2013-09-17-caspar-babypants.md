I used to love a band called The Presidents of the United States of America (P.U.S.A), mostly the things they did in the 90s like Peaches, Lump, Kitty, and Back Porch. I haven't heard much of what they did in the 00s but I'm tempted to check it out along with the rest of their back catalogue. 
I digress, Chris Ballow the vocalist and bassitarist of the band started a project in 2009 called 
[Caspar Babypants](http://www.babypantsmusic.com) aimed at toddlers. Stompy the bear is a great example and it's not that different from what P.U.S.A did! 

There are 6 albums of these and I've only scratched the surface. Enjoy!
