Sometime John Somnez hits the nail on the head, sometimes he hits the same nail many different ways. 
[These rules](http://simpleprogrammer.com/2015/03/16/11-rules-all-programmers-should-live-by/) are well worth a read. My personal favourite is 
>Comments are mostly evil
 
If I see a comment and the line below it doesn't make that clear then it's a sign that it needs to be renamed, usually to whatever the comment is, and then the comment can be removed because it's no longer necessary. And.. 
>Best practices are context dependent
 
This is true in so many situations, some of the tools I've been looking at like 
[Dapper](https://github.com/StackExchange/dapper-dot-net) or 
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) were developed for a particular content. While I'm sure you can use them outside that you'll be swimming against the current and may run into difficulties.
