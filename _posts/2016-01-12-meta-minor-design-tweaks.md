I'll probably never be 100% happy with the design of this blog, but it's good enough I can leave it alone. I'm using squarespace because I didn't want to get into the design of it as it can be a fairly unproductive time sink. Probably the only change I'll make it making some clearer lines and adding some curves, it'll a bit too angular. 

I didn't start a blog to design a better blog, I did it so I can try to become a better writer. 
So, for now, this is it.
