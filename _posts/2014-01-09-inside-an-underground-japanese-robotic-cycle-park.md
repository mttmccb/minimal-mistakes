Being a cyclist I both love and hate the idea of a underground robotic cycle park. I love the convenience of it, no more worrying about carrying a heavy lock around. No need to find somewhere safe to lock it. However, I really don't like the idea of letting my bike be swallowed by this machine. It could get scratched, or damaged. And what happens it my bike has extra non-standard attachments, or I just leave my pannier on. 

I don't know how common these are but I suspect they're not likely to be next to every office. On balance I think I'd consider myself one of the lucky few to be able to use them if I worked near one.
