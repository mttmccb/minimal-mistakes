As I'm working more and more with stored procudures it's always useful to go back to basic and learning about 
[parameters, variables and literals](http://www.sqlskills.com/blogs/kimberly/stored-procedure-execution-with-parameters-variables-and-literals/) from Kimberly L. Tripp is great way to start. In the SQL Server land you need consider performance, I probably wouldn't use variables which seem to be the biggest problem. 
Like the best articles if you read through it you'll find more gems and 
[Building High Performance Stored Procedures](https://www.sqlskills.com/blogs/kimberly/high-performance-procedures/) looks like another must read, especially as the example looks exactly like something I've been writing.
