[Visual Studio Code](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/IntroducingVisualStudioCodeForWindowsMacAndLinux.aspx) looks pretty good, I got to try it out today and I can see myself using it. I didn't get any of the ASP.NET side of things up and running but using the command line tools widely used outside the Microsoft stack was fun. A lot of it will be integrated into Visual Studio but if it's this fast I'm sure I could use it most of the time. 
It was nice to doing development on my Mac rather than on a VM on my Mac. There are definitely things I'm missing but for a first version it's pretty slick.
