One of my favourite pieces of art gets a long article, blue is a rare colour in nature so I can understand why when it became more common it was more saught after. I'd never heard of 
sakoku (foreigners weren't allow in and Japanese were allowed to leave, on penalty of death until the 1850s). Well worth a read.
