[Casey Liss](http://www.caseyliss.com) has a good summary of 
[his thoughts on Visual Studio Code](http://www.caseyliss.com/2015/5/1/visual-studio-code), I didn't realise he was a C# coder. I had similar issues getting Mono up and running so I'm hoping either it gets easier or the docs improve, I'm confident both will happen.

One interesting tidbit was the team work on 3 week sprints so there should be a new release before the end of the month.
