[]()I think Jason(
[@matigo](https://alpha.app.net/matigo)) has 
[just started a music podcast](http://jasonirwin.ca/2014/06/25/memory-lane/) that I can't make this time and he's going to be covering music from 1990 to 1994 I spent too long yesterday listening songs from the 90s not jump on writing about it. 
Also I don't want to miss out on the fun as I got a lot of my mix tape material from this period. So I'm going write about my picks. I'll also include a Spotify playlist (or 2) so you can listen to them too. Or you can listen along 
[right now](#playlist). 
I was probably coming into my formative years in music around this time being around 10-15 so I would say my music tastes were not full formed. This isn't a pre-emptive excuse for my shitty choices ;) 
Most of the music I heard came from my peers and the radio as I didn't come from a particularly musical house. Also being from the UK my choices will definitely be more biased towards it. 
So in no particular order (you don't expect to only chose five (+ 2) and rate them too!). 
##Another Preamble
 
Finding music was massively helped by having access to Spotify however I still have to refer to some old mix tapes 
and find something to play them on. I'm also aware that there were some gaps on Spotify, the only one I particularly noticed that a distinct lack of Placebo. 
It was actually tricky to find music that definitely came from this time period some of it was re-released, remixed or covered. Only the latter of those I'm letting through, so no True Faith '94 by New Order in this list. I'm sure not every one applies this draconian restriction and songs you heard in that time period but not from it is perfectly fine. 
Also my memory is very unreliable when it comes to music but release dates are fixed. 
My starting point was 51 songs and I'm sure that will continue to increase as I've tried to limit the number of tracks per artist. 
##"What's Up?" by 4 Non Blondes [1993]
 
I love Linda Perry's voice in this song and the song is very catchy. It still gives me shivers listening to it over 20 years later. 
She has gone on to produce and write a 
lot more catchy music since and still records music, her iPhone sessions are worth looking for. 
##"Shine" by Aswad [1994]
 
The lyrics are so upbeat and the horn section helps: 
Come on and shine, shine like a star (Shine, ah ha) Shining so bright, like the star that you are (Ah ha, ah ha) Oh, oh, oh, oh, shine into the future (Shine, ah ha) Spreading your light wherever you are (Ah ha, ah ha) 
The whole song is basically saying you should never give up and can achieve anything. I didn't realise until I'd read the lyrics that it name checks Linford Christie, Chris Eubank, Nigel Benn, Colin Jackson and Ian Wright who were all big black sports stars of the era. 
I hope you enjoy it. 
##"7 Seconds" by Youssou N'Dour and Neneh Cherry [1994]
 
This was probably my first experience of "World music" I don't remember hearing any in anything other than English before this and here we are with 3 languages (Wolof, French and English). 
I suspect this song had an influence on my outlook on race which is fantastic, I hope this did the same to whoever heard it. 
##"Supa Scoopa and the Might Scoop" by Kyuss [1994]
 
I'm pretty sure I didn't hear this song at the time but it's become one of my favourite stoner rock tracks because of the amazing sounds of the guitars combined with the driving drumbeats and the wailing of John Garcia. 
It's certainly not a pop song but it helps me drift away to another place, probably into another worldly dessert. 
##"Wild Wood" by Paul Weller [1993]
 
I really didn't like Paul Weller at the time probably because he was a wrinkly old rocker, now that I'm becoming more wrinkly myself that's become less of an issue. 
It also has memories of an old friend as it was played at his funeral he was a huge Weller fan and I tear up every time I listen to the song. It helps that it's a fantastic song that hold up to repeat listens. 
##"Mr Self Destruct" by Nine Inch Nails [1994]
 
This was another song I heard when I was a bit older and in my teens but I was blown as away when I first heard it. I got a copy of 
The Downward Spiral from a friend and along with "Happy Nation by Ace of Base (shush) it was in my car stereo almost constantly as loud as it would go. 
##"Suzanne" by Weezer [1994]
 
I think I first heard this song on Mallrats, the Kevin Smith movie and then for many years later struggled to find the song as it was a B-Side on a single! Those sort of problems just don't happen as much in the days of streaming music. 
It's a great bit of guitar pop. 
Apart from the odd band here and there who never made it into the digital world. 
##Narrowly missed out...
 
This is where I cheat and name a bunch of songs that I liked but couldn't write enough about them to justify including them: 
*"Two Princes" by Spin Doctors [1991] - this was on the radio so often I can guess it in a few notes!
 
*"Oblivion" by Terrorvision [1994] - Doo wop!
 
*"Black Hole Sun" by Soundgarden [1994] - The video looks so cheap now.
 
*"Nothing Compares 2 U" by Sinead O'Connor [1990] - This video was cheap but fantastic.
 
*"Out of Space" by The Prodigy [1994] - This was from the first album I ever wanted, I never got it in the end.
 
*"Fade into You" by Mazzy Star [1993] - Ahead of it's time and an influential band.
 
*"Detachable Penis" by King Missile [1992] - One of the first comedy songs I heard apart from maybe "Mick Me Mate The Master Farter" by Kevin Bloody Wilson
 
*"What is Love" by Haddaway [1993] - Baby don't hurt me... I was probably hurt a fair few times after this..
 
*"Missing" by Everything But The Girl [1994] - This song just feels nostalgic
 
*"Boom! Shake the Room" by DJ Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince [1993] - Back when he did more than shitty movies he was actually good a making music.
 
*"The Sign" by Ace of Base [1992] - I wasn't joking I like this song and whole album!
 
*"Dub be good to me" by Beats International [1990] - this should really be on the list, so many early rollerskating and cinema memories.
 
*"Dreams" by The Cranberries [1993] - "Zombie" was great but this feels more upbeat
 
*"Insane In The Brain" by Cypress Hill [1993] - popular with sk8ers the world over
 
*"Groove Is In The Heart" by Deee-lite [1990] - The extra e is not typo :P
 
*"Unbelievable" by EMF [1990] - Another classic intro.
 
*"Jump Around" by House of Pain [1993] - A test of your age you don't feel the need to jump around to this one.
 
*"Hallelujah" by Jeff Buckley - A fantastic cover by a great singer.
 
*"Come Baby Come" by K7 [1993] - how did this get on here...
 
*"Glory Box" by Portishead [1994] - I could pick any song from this album they're all fantastic
 
*"Killer" by Seal [1991] - A superb singer who really need more original material.
 
*"Where Did You Sleep Last Night" by Nirvana [1994] - It wouldn't be complete without a Nirvana song, 
Unplugged in New York was the first CD Album I owned.
