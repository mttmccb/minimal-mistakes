---It's a bit of a leading one as I'm mainly going to refer to Dwayne Charrington on at 
[I Like Kill Nerds](http://ilikekillnerds.com/2015/03/aurelia-vs-react-js-based-on-actual-use/). He's been using both Aurelia and React.js together. I'm not sold on the way React.js needs another file type just so it can deal with it's XML-like templates. I prefer to write HTML and use the string interpolation approach that Aurelia takes. It's possible to use them together however as Aurelia is modular and React.js is another module for views.
