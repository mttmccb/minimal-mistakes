A 
[very interesting insight](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-33395130) into how cycling differs in the UK from Europa and particularly in Cardiff. As a regular cyclist in the city I pick my routes carefully. If I can avoid cars, specific roads and right turns then all the better.

I takes a certain personality to cycle in the UK as you can get some blatant hostility or cars (especially large 4x4s and buses!) driving way too close. Drivers don't realise what a slight nudge or clip could do to a cyclist.

In the UK I think the answer is to expand the cycle path network, Bristol by contrast is very nice to cycle in, but only because you're pretty well separated from traffic.
