While looking into the annotate in Visual Studio I found this great blog over on 
[Coding Horror](http://blog.codinghorror.com/who-wrote-this-crap/). 
>"There's a knee-jerk predisposition to look at code you didn't write, and for various reasons large and small, proclaim it absolute crap. But figuring out who's actually responsible for that crappy code takes some detective work."
 
In my case it was me, again. What's handy is although this was originally a TFS feature it works with Git too.
