I'm not sure about TypeScript yet but [this post](http://blog.durandal.io/2015/05/06/getting-started-with-aurelia-and-typescript/) has got my reconsidering it, I've also had a quick play with it and it was surprisingly easy. I'm still struggling with the build part, mainly the process to build and dealing with all the different package managers out there. I haven't really spent any time understanding how they work so but I think it would be time well spent.
