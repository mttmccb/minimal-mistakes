The premise is simple, I'm going to review all the movies I watched in a given month. I'm going to try to keep the reviews to no more than a few paragraphs and I'm not going to rate them. If they are good I'll find a fun movie poster so go along with it.

I've split movies into 2 categories, Grown-up and Kids, there may be a grey around between them.

##Grown-up Movies (8)


###Gulliver's Travel's (2010)


You know the period when Jack Black made one terrible movie after another? Well this is worse than all of those combined. If you want to point someone to example of how to destroy a decent story, this is it. I hope all of the actors in this movie are ashamed of themselves, although I'm pretty sure Jack Black isn't capable of shame.

###The Eagle (2011)


I was surprised by this one. Particularly by Channing Tatum's performance as Marcus Aquila, the son of a shamed Roman centurion who lost the eagle standard in northern Britain (Scotland to you and me). It made a change not to see him as hoodlum. There was an interesting turning of tables and it was very entertaining. Some sagging plot holes and dialogue choices let it down but overall it was enjoyable.

###Metropolis (2001)


So slow. I really want to like this. But the animation was all over the place as was the plot. It was painfully slow and there were many over indulgent panning shots.

###Tower Heist (2011)


Like Jack Black, Ben Stiller also had a period where he made a load of terrible movies playing the same character over and over. This was almost one of those but the plot and the interaction between the characters saved it for me. It took a bit of time to build up to the ultimate goal but it worked well.

###The Descendants (2011)


Interesting story, George Clooney playing the same character again. I probably didn't give this one the attention it deserved but it didn't quite do enough to capture it.

###The Man from Earth (2007)


I can't think of another cinematic example but TV shows did this a lot to save money. That is they shot an episode in one set. The majority of the movie is in one place and listening to and disbelieving the story of the man telling them it. As it goes on they get more emotional for their own different reasons, it's an interesting thought and worth your time. It's slow to start but stick with it.

###Seven Samurai (1954)


This reminded me a lot of 13 assassins although it came around long before it. It was an epic story that built slowly, the 2nd half of the movie definitely picked up the pace. I won't spoilt it but it's worth sticking with the black and white.

###Detention (2011)


Like the Descendants I was really paying attention to this one, there was a lot going on in this Scream-like hipster festâ€¦ that said it felt like it was entertaining but I wasn't really in the mood for it. I'll probably watch it again and give a better summary.

##Kids Movies (6)


###Despicable Me (2010) and Despicable Me 2 (2013)


These movies are good fun and it's interesting to see the differences in the style because they start in very different places. The first is the story of Gru trying to be a villain, avoiding being a father and becoming a hero and the second of him becoming a hero stopping a villain and being a father. It's not quite that simple but until I review it again it will do :)

###Toy Story 2 (1999) and Toy Story 3 (2010)


It's amazing how similar these are, especially the villains. I'd completely forgotten the second one and the stereotype of the comic book guys. The bear in the 3rd is still creepy. 
![I couldn't find the original source for this one :(](/images/static_52001c0be4b09bc7c9f838c9_52224ed3e4b0ba9919a3e0e1_54cfd4cee4b092432af690d9_1422906580241_wall-e-poster-mockup.gif) I couldn't find the original source for this one :( 
###Wall-E (2008)
 
If you haven't seen this yet then you really need to. For most of the movie there is no dialogue and it's a very cute story. And I'm definitely not going to say anything else about it. 
###Finding Nemo (2003)
 
I still don't like this one, I don't know why, next time I watch it I try to think of a better review. 
##Summary
 
Apart from Seven Samurai none of the movies were on my watch list, it takes a fair bit of effort to find and watch movies that everyone in the house agrees with. For some reason 2011 was popular this month, perhaps because my daughter was born late that year so we didn't go to the cinema much that year, or since! 
Maybe this will become a thing or it might be the only time I do this, hope you enjoyed reading.
