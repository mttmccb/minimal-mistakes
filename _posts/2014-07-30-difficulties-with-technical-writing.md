The last few weeks I've been struggling to write about some technical subjects I've been learning more about and have been pulled down a few rabbit holes. In fact I've written a couple thousand words that haven't been published yet. 
I think what is stopping me from pulling the trigger on the posts I've prepared is my desire to make sure they are easily understood by 
anyone. I've read so many blog posts that (rightly?) assume a lot of knowledge but they make assumptions on relatively new concepts. 
Writing about technical subjects so they can be understood by 
anyone is a noble goal but it's not possible. What 
is possible is letting your audience know what I've assumed you know beforehand. 
What I'm going to try to do is start each blog post with a paragraph (or more) cover this this before I get into the details. 
As with all guidelines I like to set there's a good chance I'll break them. :)
