It was a light month for movies but I saw the big blockbuster of the year.

##Avengers: Age of Ultron


Sadly it was nothing like the 
[90s edition](http://mttmccb.net/blog/2015/avengers-age-of-ultron-90s-edition?rq=age) I shared last month but it was a lot like a really long trailer. The action scenes stuck around too long and the plot got thinner and thinner as things went on. It did feel a lot more like one comic book than most, one of the shiny foil cover ones ;)

There were positives in the voice acting, James Spader did a great job and I've always liked Paul Bettany as Jarvis. Along with Kevin Spacey as GERTY in Moon he's one of my favourite computer voices.

If you've been watching Agents of Shield (shame on us all) then you'll be spoiled a little as they still haven't caught up with the movie yet.
