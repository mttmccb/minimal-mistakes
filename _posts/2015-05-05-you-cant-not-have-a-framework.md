[Ryan Florence](http://blog.ryanflorence.com/you-cant-not-have-a-framework.html) does a great job of clear up a debate I've been having with myself on Frameworks (Libraries, Modules, Extensions, Methodologies...) and he makes it clear that by making no choice you're still making one but please don't do it accidentally. Make it your choice to build the best one out there, but be prepared for a lot of work.
