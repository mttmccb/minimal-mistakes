Although I don't think 
[Ampersand.js](http://read.humanjavascript.com) is for me right now I do think 
[@HenrikJoreteg](https://twitter.com/HenrikJoreteg) is an excellent communicator both visually with his 
[video tutorial](http://learn.humanjavascript.com) and although I've only skimmed a few chapters I think the online book 
[Human JavaScript](http://read.humanjavascript.com) already looks to be an excellent read. Worth reading the first chapter to see if it would benefit you too. If you have anything to do with web applications then I'm sure it will.
