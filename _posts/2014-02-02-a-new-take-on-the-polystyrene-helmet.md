While I've been lucky enough not to be in a position to test out my cycling helmet I do wonder if the polystyrene helmet offers me that much protection. 
Thankfully people like Anirudha Surabhi are still innovating with helmets built using a special honeycomb cardboard inspired by a woodpecker's beak. 
I'm looking forward to getting my hand on one of these helmets as they look to reduce the G-force experienced during a collision. 

In fact the Abus Kranium AKS 1 has [been reviewed](http://www.bikeradar.com/mtb/news/article/abus-kranium-aks-1-cardboard-helmet-just-in-36144/) and you can find one on [velorution](http://www.velorution.com/abus-kranium-aks1-cardboard-helmet/) for Â£79.99. Interestingly their marketing spiel suggests they can survive 5 collisions where most polystyrene helmets a useless after one. 

To be fair I'm never going to test that, I'd probably give cycling a break after getting hit 3 times!
