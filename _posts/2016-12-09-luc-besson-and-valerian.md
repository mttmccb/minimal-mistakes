If you've never seen the classic cheesy sci-fi [The Fifth Element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fifth_Element) then you should stop reading and watch it immediately. It propelled the career of Milla Jovovich and was one of Gary Oldman's best villian roles (surpassed only by his role in [Léon: The Professional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9on:_The_Professional), also by Besson). Not to mention it had a blonde Bruce Willis and a gloriously camp Chris Tucker.

The thing that set it apart was sense of fun and over the top visuals. It's not for everyone and it felt like [Jupiter Ascending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_Ascending) was the closest we'd get. There aren't many writers like Luc Besson but he will certain keep you entertained. 

## Any hidden gems?
The parkour laden action movie [District 13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_13) is a favourite and the [Taxi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxi_(1998_film)) films are fun but certainly not masterpieces. 

I had no idea about [Cinéma du look](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cin%C3%A9ma_du_look) but it looks like it could worth seeing [Subway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subway_(film)), [The Big Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Blue) and [Nikita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikita_(film))

[Bandidas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandidas) also looks promising, I mean Salma Hayek and Penélope Cruz in the same movie!

## Give me more action
[Taken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taken_(film)) and [The Transporter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Transporter) and [Columbiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombiana), [Unleashed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unleashed_(film)) all pretty good. His sequels are generally pretty poor though and usually seem like a cash grab, Transporter 2 and 3 were awful.

## What's his sci-fi record like?
Apart from The Fifth Element he recently wrote and directed [Lucy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_(2014_film)) which was thoughtful but lacking some heart. He seems to like to bringing comics to life, [The Extraordinary Adventures of Adèle Blanc-Sec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Extraordinary_Adventures_of_Ad%C3%A8le_Blanc-Sec_(film)) is another one based on a comic on my watch list.

## Valérian and Laureline
So he has a good track record of entertaining action, thoughtful sci-fi, visually interesting and well written movies. So when I saw the trailer for [Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valerian_and_the_City_of_a_Thousand_Planets) I was excited. It's also based on a popular French however it's hard to see the potential in it based on the first glances.

Watch it for yourself.
