A fantastic 
[series of posts](http://blog.garstasio.com/you-dont-need-jquery/) covering the reasons you don't need jQuery anymore. Sometimes the answer is to dump it entirely but there are plenty lightweight focussed frameworks to make your life a little easier without giving you a load of features you'll never use. 
I think a combination of the rolling your own and cherry picking the best parts is the good choice, at least then if do you the monolithic framework is entirely your fault ;)
