I'm left handed, I forget what proportion of the world are (and it varies around the world) but when it's 'discovered' I always get a surprised reaction. I'm not sure what people expect from left-handed people. 
I've never been one to hunt out left-handed options, perhaps it's because there have never been options around, I've just found ways round scissors. 
I don't feel any sense of solidarity with fellow lefties. 
Sorry, you happen to use a different hand to most of the world, we might have something else in common but the same could be said of those who use the other hand.
