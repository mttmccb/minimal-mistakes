[short post on CTEs](http://www.brentozar.com/archive/2015/03/sql-server-common-table-expressions/) by Jeremiah Peschka is a great example of where reading the comments section doesn't make you dispair for humanity and it has swayed my opinion on them. Which version of SQL Server you're using plays a big part on the approaches you might use, but either way you should test your queries. The more I read the more difficult that is, it's not always as clear as you'd think.
