It wasn't too surprising that Microsoft decided not to release the Microsoft Band 3. I read it was because it doesn't run Windows 10 but that doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.

I've been using a Microsoft band since the first version was released on x. When the 2nd one came out last year immediately got hold of one. I'm no Microsoft fan boy but it had all the capabilities I was looking for in a reasonably priced package.

As a regular macOS and iOS I couldn't care less about integration with the my OS. The strengths are the number of sensors 

## When it sucked
- multiple replacements 
- GPS flakiness
- Splitting straps

## When it worked
It's great, I can get GPS, heart rate, elevation as well as music control and a watch.

## When it dies
I won't be replacing it with a Microsoft band, unless they do something new. Sometime in 2017 or 2018 I'll be in the market for a device with similar capabilities but reliability will high on the wish list.

Looking at the options in more detail is for another post but it probably won't be a fitbit, possible either Garmin or Polar. But you quickly get into the professional and expensive range.
