When I finally get my shiny new iPhone 5S next month I'm not going to just ram it full of apps. In the spirit of 
[#teamappminimal](https://alpha.app.net/hashtags/teamappminimal) I'll be carefully considering the apps I put on my phone, in fact I'll only install an app when I've written a blog post of at least 500 words. 
I 
will be motivated to write as are plenty of apps I want to use, I'm hoping this will help me consider them more carefully, how they fit into my workflow, how I'm likely to use them, etc... 
Of course I have about a month to consider the apps and possibly get a head start on a few blog posts of my essential apps
