I've gone on about podcasts before but I haven't shared what's in my playlist. It's in a slightly better way so I don't feel so ashamed and it's also a very personal choice. I'm hoping by giving you more information on those I listened to and those I don't that it will help you decided if you might like what I'm currently listening to. Alternatively you could have a look a 
[podcast thing](http://podcastthing.com) for some recommendations, I will be.

On making this list I realise how many years I've been listening to podcasts and how many have come and gone. It's very likely I've left something off the list.

**This post will be continually updated, this is what's still left to do:**

*Add links to all shows, except those to avoid.
 
*Update descriptions on Current Podcasts.
 
*Add some show art (Current only) 
#What else am I looking for?
 
Hard to say at the moment, let me get back to you on that. Certainly not more Tech podcasts.
