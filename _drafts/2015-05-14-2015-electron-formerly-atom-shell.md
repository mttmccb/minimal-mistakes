The list of companies using 
[Electron](http://electron.atom.io) is promising (Visual Studio Code just released it) and the promise of building 
cross platform desktop apps with web technologies is a lofty one. A cursory look at the docs make it look possible. 
As I'm at a cross road in so many ways lately I'm looking at this seriously too, anything that means I get to continue to improve my web skill is great, it's just understand the benefits of web app over an electron app.
