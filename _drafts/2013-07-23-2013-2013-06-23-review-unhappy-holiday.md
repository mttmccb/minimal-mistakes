I'm going to try writing up my regular reviews, I can't promise they will happen weekly but it will be pretty close.

##Recap


Last week I set myself some 
[Jobs to kill in the next 9 days](/blog/2013/jobs-to-kill-in-the-next-9-days). At the time I assessed the 6 jobs as 4 big jobs, 1 small one and an easy one. My goal was get at least 3 of them completed.

###How did I do


I didn't achieve my goal but I did make 
progress in 3 of them.

***Mow the lawn**
*I've done this so many times new I can get it done in around 90 minutes. The lawn is pretty weedy but as long as its short I don't care too much.


***Hang pictures**
*No pictures have been hung but I have done research on how best to do it and identified the best walls, there was a lot of moving around of furniture last week.


***Resealing the bath/shower**
*Again it's not done but I've removed the old shower cover and replaced it with a shower curtain.

I've been journaling my progress in 
[Day One](http://dayoneapp.com/) and I'm using this as a way to think through the problems and steps to getting things done. Am I missing equipment, tools or knowledge? How am I going to sort these out. I'm going to keep doing this as it has been really helpful.

###What else did I get done


*Survived a visit from my parents for 7 of the 9 days. I planned on them being more helpful than they were.


*Build a 
[Moheda](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=moheda%20ikea&source=web&cd=5&sqi=2&ved=0CDsQFjAE&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fgb%2Fen%2Fcatalog%2Fproducts%2F50213952%2F&ei=-EjHUa2aJeiw0QXJxYDICQ&usg=AFQjCNGrWx7iqs3LsT6QjLn0MyZJ1Se-EQ&sig2=n01w058cr1mtHzcymgvVsA) sofa bed, it was on sale and we were looking for one. This killed about 5 hours due a broken part.


*Clear out loads of junk from the living room. We can almost invite people over without feeling embarrassed.


*Spent the day in Bristol, visiting the 
[Bristol Aquarium](http://www.bristolaquarium.co.uk/) and eating out at 
[Turtle Bay](http://www.turtlebay.co.uk/bristol-restaurant/).


*Got my stove top coffee makers sorted out.

###What am I going to do differently


I don't often get a week off, much less a holiday. So I need to learn from this past week, here goes...

*Apply the 
[Rule of 3](http://gettingresults.com/wiki/The_Rule_of_3), I aimed too high and ended up being less focussed on 6 different things. If I aim for 3 and get more done then that's a bonus.


*Make sure all my outcomes tie in with a project or task in 
[Omnifocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/). When I was doing this it really helped me focus on what I could realistically do that day, and also when I could do other activities. Mowing the law is easy but I can't do it when it raining. The activities that I didn't log in Omnifocus or at least planned to do, didn't happen.


*Break it down. This links into the item above of breaking a project down into steps and tasks that can actually be done.


*Plan for interruptions. With a young family and parents in town I often had very short windows of time to do things but my tasks were too chunky. 20-30 minutes is going to be my aim.


*Rest. I quickly became very tired as I was still getting woken at 5-6AM and going to sleep too late. I've got hold of 
[SleepBot](http://mysleepbot.com/) to help monitor this but I really just need to learn to sleep earlier.


*Plan something fun. My outcomes didn't have anything fun planned and it wasn't until a few days ago we did something properly fun and visited the aquarium.


*Get help. Childcare, professionals or just willing hands to half the time would have made it all easier. For various reasons none of these happened.


*Put anything not being progressed on hold. This will help keep the focus on what I am committed to.

##Next week


I'm back at work and there is a possibility of travel and an overnight stay, I really only have Saturday to kill off the big jobs and evening to chip away at them. Rather than planning to kill 3 I'm going to aim for 1, 
**Resealing the bath/shower**
. Wish me luck.
