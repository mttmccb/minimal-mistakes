[Editorially](https://editorially.com/) looks to be a great web app for collaborating on documents on the web. It uses markdown for formatting and include some very nice change control features, as well as the ability to host discussions on particular parts of the document. 
While I don't have a need at the moment I'll definitely have it in the forefront of my mind when I the need arises. 
It's currently free and in beta, go check it out.
