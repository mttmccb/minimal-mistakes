It's been a while since I looked at which podcasts are the best in my queue. To make it easy to recommend to new people I'll give you the top 5 I'm listening to right now.

## How do you listen to them?
To put things in context I almost exclusively listen to podcasts using my iPhone, either when I'm commuting, doing chores, walking or exercising. I use [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/) which is mostly ok but a bit fiddly when it comes to getting to the show notes and it insists on shortening links.

I'm sure I'm missing things because it doesn't get 100% of my attention but I'm ok with that. One of the nice features of Overcast is being able to set the speed of each podcast and in gradually getting used to listening faster. Listening at "normal" speed makes me think some speakers are having a stroke.

## The contenders
I don't really bother with separate playlists anymore but I do select "Priority Podcasts" which is a feature of Overcast that means those podcasts are played first. The short list (in no particular order) is:

- [Shop Talk Show](http://shoptalkshow.com/) - a show about front end web design, development and UX
- [Hanselminutes](http://hanselminutes.com/) - a very accessible interview show about tech
- [ADAM BUXTON PODCAST](http://adam-buxton.co.uk/ad/category/adam-buxton-podcast/) - a slightly bonkers interview show
- [How I Built this](http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510313/how-i-built-this) - a short interview show with founders of interesting companies
- [Full Stack Radio](http://www.fullstackradio.com/) - as the name suggest it's a show about full stack web development
- [Eat This podcast](http://www.eatthispodcast.com/) - a talk show about food with some focus on the science
- [Ctrl-Walt-Delete](http://www.theverge.com/ctrl-walt-delete) - a tech show from Walt Mossberg and Nilay Patel of The Verge, a bit more focussed on news
- [The Boagworld Show](https://boagworld.com/show) - another web design show, less focus on development and more on UX
- [Merge Conflict](http://www.mergeconflict.fm/) - a weekly tech show
- [Startup Podcast](https://gimletmedia.com/startup/) - a story based show about startups
- [You Are Not So Smart](https://youarenotsosmart.com/podcast/) - a talk show about psychology and the human mind

There's a good mix of weekly shows, shows that are best listened to sooner after recording. Story-based and interview shows that are pretty timeless, where you can dip into any episode.

Again in no particular order, the ones I'd recommend you listen to are:

### You Are Not So Smart


### How I Build This


### Eat This Podcast


### ADAM BUXTON PODCAST


### Hanselminutes


## And shuffle...
I try to clear out the shows I'm not interested in or aren't listened to and add in new ones every 3 months or so, especially when I am unable to get to the end of the queue. There aren't enough hours in the day to listen to them all.
