It's been too long since I last wrote in this blog, I think I'm suffering 
[paralysis by analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis), there were a few series of blogs posts I had lined up but I could not get them done. Sorry if you were waiting for them but I'm going to start with a clean slate. It's not good for my health to be stressing about something I've lost interest in writing about. 
So I'm going to try and change the way I write, the way I think and the way I act. Which means being more impulsive, taking less time to think through things. This doesn't mean I plan on making stupid decisions, I can still make those if I take my time about it :P 
I'm going to change the focus of this blog so it reads more like a developers journal, this might open up other styles of writing but the important thing is that I'm writing. Although the focus will be web development I won't limit myself to just that. 
On a daily basis I make decisions, learn, research things that would be worthwhile writing about. I hope this is the first step in that direction. 
As a result I'll be tweaking the design (I just wasted an hour looking a templates and sticking with the current one!) to fit this change.
