In the past I've used 
[Textpattern](http://textpattern.com) and 
[Wordpress](https://wordpress.com) to build blogs and website that can be customised and administered. However I've learned since that I don't want a Content Management System (CMS) that is to closely tied to the structure and template it uses and requires acrobatics to integrate with. I want something that isn't very opinionated. 
What this usually means is that I want to be able to easily use any front end framework or backend database and the CMS ties them together without too much trouble. One way this can be achieved is by using an API to access the content, like 
[wordpress REST API](https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/wordpress-rest-api/) is aiming to do, but not Wordpress, it's still too blog-centric. 
I want to use a technology I'm already familiar with like .NET and it would probably use MVC/WebAPI. So far the front runner is 
[Umbraco](http://umbraco.com), on the surface it does the following well: 
*Easy to setup
 
*Widely used and available
 
*Large community who also develop plugins and themes
 
*Built using MVC 
Of course I need to dig deeper and I have a project in mind to test these assumptions so will be writing about that as go along.
