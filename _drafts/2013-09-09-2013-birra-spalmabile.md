I would consider myself a beer lover but spreadable beer butter might be a bit too far. However it's available in "Omid Dark" and "Greta Blonde" flavours for £7.99 from 
[Selfridges Online](http://www.selfridges.com/en/Food-Wine/Categories/NEW-IN/Omid-dark-ale-spreadable-beer-280g_554-2001326-SPREADABLEBEERALTAQUOTAOMI/) or maybe you prefer 
[Chilli Bacon Jam](http://www.selfridges.com/en/Food-Wine/Categories/NEW-IN/Chilli-Bacon-Jam-110g_554-3002437-CHILLIJAM110G/).
