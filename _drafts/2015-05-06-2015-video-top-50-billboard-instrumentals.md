A great selection of hits were brought together by 
[Cuepoint](https://medium.com/cuepoint/what-do-the-harlem-shake-star-wars-gary-glitter-hawaii-five-o-and-barry-white-have-in-common-542dc7c0c545), so many iconic tunes. Here's a few of my favourites... 
##Theme From Mission Impossible by Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr
 
This song will always remind me of the original TV show, it was always a fun show to watch. 
 
##Axel F by Harold Faltermeyer
 
Another classic, it brings Beverly Hills Cop to mind and Eddie Murphy's grin. 
 
##Chariots of Fire Theme by Vangelis
 
Although I don't think I've ever seen the movie I've heard the song many times. Quite possible in parody form. 
 
##The Entertainer by Scott Joplin; arranged by Marvin Hamlisch
 
 
##Dueling Banjos by Arthur "Guitar Boogie" Smith
 
I may need to rewatch Deliverance. 
 
##Popcorn by Hot Butter
 
I might have mentioned this one before as I love the Aphex Twin version, it's not that different from the original. 
 
##The Good, The Bad and The Ugly by Ennio Morricone
 
I'm surprised there isn't more Ennion Morricone on the list but glad this one made it.
