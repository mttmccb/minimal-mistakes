It's not the first time I've heard of Irn-Bru being banned in North America but the first I've heard of the 
[fine drink having problems in Canada](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-25867613). Apparently due to a particular food colourant. 
If you're not familiar with the orange fizzy drink then you must go immediately to buy a bottle. Probably best to drink it after a heavy night drinking as it will pick you up off the floor. 
Not in quite the same way as Red Bull would. 
Alternative you could try the new and exclusive 
[Irn-Bru ice cream](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/irnbru-unveil-new-ice-cream-in-scotland-9096615.html) which will be hitting stores in March. It does suggest this will only be in Scotland but I'm hoping it will make it to Wales along with the Wales vs Scotland 6-Nation Rubgy game.
