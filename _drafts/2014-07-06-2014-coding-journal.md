Recently I've setup myself some fairly unrealistic goals of learning a lot of complex subjects in a short period of time. I've done it by reading, watching videos, doing practical tutorials and applying what I've learned in projects I'm working on. 
It's not enough. I need to write about it to cement what I've been learning. So I'm going to do that by writing about the paths I take, those I avoid, the mistakes I make and he successes too. Don't expect 
[Coding Horror](http://blog.codinghorror.com) or 
[Exercises in .NET](http://dotnetcodr.com) but I am aiming for it to be of high quality. 
By putting it down in words I'm hoping it will help those in a similar position. 
##Main topics
 
It'll help to narrow things down a bit so here's the first attempt. 
*ASP.NET MVC (C#, Design Patterns, Web API, OOP)
 
*General Web Development (HTML5 / CSS3, jQuery, AJAX)
 
*Agile Development (Continuous Integration (CI), Git, TDD) 
I'm sure it'll change as I write more. 
##Posting schedule (not meant to be broken)
 
A few times a week would be ideal but it will likely depend on what I'm doing at the time. However, if I'm not learning something worth writing about then it's a good barometer that it's not a good week. 
##Ground rules (meant to be broken)
 
*Explain the context of any examples
 
*Provide downloadable code, ideally in a self contained project 
I'll add more if need be. 
##Ready, set...
 
Go.
