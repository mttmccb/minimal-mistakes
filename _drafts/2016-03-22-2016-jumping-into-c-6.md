I watched a few videos on 
[Pluralsight](http://pluralsight.com), I found 
[Exporing C# 6 with Jon Skeet](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/csharp-with-jon-skeet) a very good way to get an insights into the new features. On top of that 
[Play by Play: C# Q&A with Scott Allen and Jon Skeet](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/play-by-play-csharp-q-and-a-with-scott-allen-and-jon-skeet) was very good to provide some more complex examples. 
##Taking a leap
 
I decided to try using it on the project I'm working on to see what the experience was like. Because I wanted to use it in production too I installed 
[.net 4.6.1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=48130) on the server, it needed a reboot but luckily I managed to fit that in with other updates I needed to do. 
I later found out you 
[probably don't need to get the latest version](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28921701/does-c-sharp-6-0-work-for-net-4-0). 
##Top Features
 
It would be pretty easy to pick string interpolation as my favourite when you can do 
$"{name} was born on {dob:dd mmm yyyy}"

instead of 
String.Format("{0} was born on {1:dd mmm yyyy}", name, dob)

but I don't think that's it. 
I'm really liking 
using static so I can remove a lot of cruft which are essentially references to the same static class over and over. You can use it with library class like 
System.Math, your own static classes and even Enums. 
String interpolation reminds me a lot of the new features in JavaScript ES6 but following on from that is expression body members. It's a rubbish name and I don't fully understand what it means expect it means that this 
public decimal MoneyEarned { get { return MonthlyWage * 12 - Tax; } }

becomes 
public decimal MoneyEarned => MonthlyWage * 12 - Tax;

While not on the same scale as string interpolation (although I have found situations where I am combining both) it certain makes it a lot simpler to understand. 
The final one is 
nameof, I didn't fully understand this at first and managed to bodge a bit refactoring while trying to use it but it will essentially get rid of strings which refer to field name or variable names. 
I'm using it when I need to get a property name which maps to stored procedure parameter for example instead of 
p.AddParameter("@Name", person.Name)

I can get rid of the string and do 
p.AddParameter(@"@{nameof(Name)}", person.Name)

It's a pretty verbose example but what this mean is it I refactor the Name property then I don't have to update the variable, in the first one my renaming of Name would not rename the variable (in some case this might be fine).

##Go for it..


It was really easy to get started with C# 6 and use it in production, if you're able to then just start using it. You might find Dustin Campbell's 
[C# Essentials extension](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/a4445ad0-f97c-41f9-a148-eae225dcc8a5) useful as it will highlight some changes to use the new syntax in Visual Studio. It can also help you do the refactorings with a few clicks.

I'm sure there will be more to share but after looking into it for a few days those are the immediate highlights.
