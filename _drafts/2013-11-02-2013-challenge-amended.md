I just couldn't do it, I couldn't write reviews I'm happy with fast enough. The need to get my shiny new iPhone 5S setup the way I want it with all the apps I 'need' was too much.

So I have installed nearly all the apps I had on my iPhone 4S before I sold it. The only notable exception is Facebook, I only check that on my iPad and that's becoming more infrequent.

So the changes to the Challenges are

*Review all the apps within 30 days of installing them, as there are some apps that don't last that long some might not even be reviewed


*Group reviews together where appropriate, some apps are either so simple they don't need 500 words.

I'm hoping this will be a weight off my shoulders and get me writing again. As a quick preview of what to expect here's my current homescreen.
