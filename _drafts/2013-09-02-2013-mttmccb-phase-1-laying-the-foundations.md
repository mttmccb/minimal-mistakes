I've only had this site for a few days and already I'm pretty happy with it. But it isn't without a few snags.

##Cosmetic


*Add some icons, courtesy of 
[Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/), just don't over do it.
 2013-09-02


*Add a link to ADN and get my domain verified.
 2013-09-01


*Sort out the menu colour, brown doesn't look great on the mobile version, I like orange but it's a little bright. Decisions, decisions.

*Add in a better blog separator might need to use a little bit of jQuery or maybe look into developer mode if the template doesn't support it.
 2013-09-06, I'm happy with it the way it is.

##Content


*Add the Map with all the place I've been with a bit of context behind it.
 2013-09-05, well half done


*Add in longer term plans, this will likely be a working list.
 2013-09-05


*Update the summary on the about page, it's too long.
 2013-09-05


*Check the imported blog posts are all formatted correctly.
 2013-09-06, App Store Icon Quest needs to be fixed


*Check the RSS feeds are working correctly.
 2013-09-06


*Add in the best way to contact / find me but not too close ;)

##Structure


*Add in an Archive view.
 2013-09-06, I don't need one right now


*Add in an RSS link to the footer.
 2013-09-06, add it to the header
